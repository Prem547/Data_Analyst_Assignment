--Explanation:

--The code starts with a Common Table Expression (CTE) named events. The CTE events defines the temporary table that holds the event data with columns id, occur_time, and close_time. The VALUES clause is used to provide the sample data for these columns.

--The next CTE named tasks_with_task_id is defined. In this CTE, we calculate the task_id for each event occurring before its corresponding close_time. The subquery within this CTE uses a correlated subquery to find the number of distinct occur_time values from the events table (aliased as e2) where the id matches the current row's id and the occur_time is less than the current row's close_time. This count essentially gives us the task_id for each event based on the chronological order of the events.

--The final SELECT statement retrieves the desired output columns: id, task_id, MIN(occur_time) (earliest occur_time within each task), and MAX(close_time) (latest close_time within each task). The results are grouped by id and task_id, and the rows are ordered by id and task_id.

--The final output displays the task_id, earliest occur_time, and latest close_time for each task, as required in the task description.

--The query efficiently assigns task_ids to events occurring before their corresponding close_times and calculates the required metrics for each task. The results are sorted based on id and task_id, which helps in visualizing the tasks in chronological order.
